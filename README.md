Pandanite 
====================
<image src="img/logo.png" width=350/>

[Pandanite](http://www.bamboocrypto.io) is a minimalist implementation of a layer 1 cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin. It is designed with utmost simplicity and user friendliness in mind and is written from the ground up in C++ â€” it isn't yet another re-packaging of existing open-source blockchain code (where's the fun in that?!). 

### Circulation
Pandanite is minted by miners who earn rewards. Mining payments occur using the *thwothirding* algorithm, which yields a total final circulation of ~100M PDN:
- 50 PDN per block until block 666666
- 50\*(2/3) PDN per block from blocks 666667 to 2\*666666
- 50\*(2/3)^2 PDN per block from blocks 2\*66666+1 to 3\*666666
etc.
#### Comparison with halving
Block reward changes are more often and have less impact compared to halving:

The payout curve is smoother in twothirding compared to halving:

### Technical Implementation
Pandanite is written from the ground up in C++. We want the Pandanite source code to be simple, elegant, and easy to understand. Rather than adding duct-tape to an existing currency, we built Pandanite from scratch with lots of love. There are a few optimizations that we have made to help further our core objectives:
* Switched encryption scheme from [secp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/secp256k1) (which is used by ETH & BTC) to [ED25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) -- results in 8x speedup during verification and public keys half the size. 
* Up to 25,000 transactions per block, 90 second block time

### Getting Started
*Windows*: 
Windows is not currently supported as a build environment. You may run the [dcrptd miner](https://github.com/De-Crypted/dcrptd-miner/releases) to mine Pandanite

*Mac OSX* build pre-requirements
```
brew install leveldb
brew install cmake
pip3 install conan
```


*Linux* install pre-requirements
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install make cmake automake libtool python3-pip libleveldb-dev
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python python /usr/bin/python3.6 1
sudo pip3 install conan
sudo apt install git
```

### Building
```
git clone https://github.com/pandanite-crypto/pandanite
cd pandanite
mkdir build
cd build
conan install .. --build=missing
cd ..
cmake .
```
To compile the miner run the following command:
```
make miner
```
You will also need the keygen app to create a wallet for your miner:
```
make keygen
```

To compile the node server:
```
make server
```

### Usage
Start by generating `keys.json`.

```
./bin/keygen
```
 ***Keep a copy of this file in a safe location*** -- it contains pub/private keys to the wallet that the miner will mint coins to. If you lose this file you lose your coins. We recommend keeping an extra copy on a unique thumbdrive (that you don't re-use) the moment you generate it.


To start mining:
```
./bin/miner
```

To host a node:
```
./bin/server
```

### Docker

Pandanite is pre-built for amd64 and arm64 with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pandanite-crypto/pandanite/actions) and distributed with the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/pandanite-crypto/pandanite/pkgs/container/pandanite)

#### Running with Docker

with `docker`

```shell
docker run -d --name pandanite -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/pandanite-data:/pandanite/data ghcr.io/pandanite-crypto/pandanite:latest server
docker logs -f pandanite
```

You can follow the progress of server sync from `http://localhost:3000`

Running with `docker-compose` is recommended to easily add more options like cpu usage limits and a health checks:

```yaml
version: '3.4'

services:
  pandanite:
    image: ghcr.io/pandanite-crypto/pandanite:latest
    command: server
    ports:
      - 3000:3000
    volumes:
      - ./pandanite-data:/pandanite/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    cpus: 8
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-sf", "http://127.0.0.1:3000"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
```

#### Building with docker

Clone this repository and then

```shell
docker build . -t pandanite
docker run [OPTIONS] pandanite server
```

Running CI build locally
```shell
docker run --privileged --rm tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
docker buildx create --use

GITHUB_REPOSITORY=NeedsSomeValue GITHUB_SHA=NeedsSomeValue docker buildx bake --progress=plain
```
